# While True Do: Website

Website Content for [while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io)

## Motivation

As a community, we wanted to represent ourselves and have a link to reach us.

## Description

The website / landing page should deliver the following information:

-   Motivation
-   Ideals
-   Development Contributions
-   Community Contributions
-   Links to some areas and other websites

## Requirements

The website uses [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and
[Style Cheat](https://github.com/style-cheat).

## Installation

You need to clone the repository and a webserver like httpd, nginx or github
pages will deliver the **index.html**.

```
git clone https://github.com/while-true-do/website.git
```

## Usage

A webserver needs to be configured and point to the **index.html**.

## Testing

Most of the "generic" tests are located our
[Test Library](https://github.com/while-true-do/test-library). Tests and
instructions for a single repository are located in the
[Test Directory](./tests).
